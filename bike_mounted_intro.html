            <h3>Portable. But Powerful</h3>
            <p>A fire can start anywhere, at anytime. And in just 6 minutes, it can turn into an uncontrollable blaze.
                This makes it even more important for you to tackle the fire, before it's too late.</p>
            <p>Unfortunately, tiny lanes, inaccessible roads and traffic jams all are a setback when it comes to rushing
                to the rescue. Which means that by the time the fire engine reaches the scene of the fire, it could very
                possibly already be too late.</p>
            <p>The need of the hour is a fire engine that can manoeuvre any road, zip through traffic and reach the
                burning premises in minutes.</p>
            <p>Ceasefire introduces a state-of-the-art extinguisher on wheels - The Mobile Firefighter. Powered by the
                world's most revolutionary firefighting technology: Watermist.</p>

        <div class="how_it_works">
            <h3>Watermist Technology and How it Works</h3>
            <p>Ceasefire's patented Watermist technology uses the world's oldest, most effective fire suppressant -
                water, increasing its power many times over.</p>
            <p>Here's how. Ceasefire extinguishers equipped with Watermist break water down into a fine mist. This mist
                is then thrown at the fire with a great kinetic force, covering a large surface area. As soon as the
                mist comes in contact with the fire, it instantly turns into steam. Enveloping the flames, cutting down
                the oxygen supply and reducing the temperature to below combustion levels. Ensuring that even the
                largest fire succumbs to Watermist technology. In minutes.</p>
